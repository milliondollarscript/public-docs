# Admin Navigation

This is a quick map of the Million Dollar Script admin pages so you know where to look when configuring or troubleshooting.

## Top-level

- Million Dollar Script (Dashboard)
  - Landing page with links to key areas and version info.

## Key submenus

- Admin
  - Legacy core administration (Manage Grids, Price Zones, Not For Sale, Backgrounds, Orders lists, Click Reports, Process Pixels, Main Config, System Information, License, etc.).
  - Use this when you need fine‑grained grid controls or to view operational reports.

- Options
  - Carbon Fields options for routes, theme, pixels, login, WooCommerce, logging, and more.
  - Saving Options regenerates dynamic CSS.

- Setup Wizard
  - Creates recommended pages (Grid, Order, Manage, List, Payment/Thank‑You), applies defaults, and saves Options.

- Logs
  - Toggle logging, clear the log, and view live updates. Useful during setup and payment flow testing.

- Emails
  - Configure email settings/messages used by the plugin (where applicable).

- Changelog
  - View recent feature and fix summaries bundled with the plugin.

- Extensions (if present)
  - Explore and manage optional add‑ons when available.

- Approve Pixels (utility)
  - Dedicated screen for reviewing and bulk‑approving orders/pixels.

Notes

- Some screens are modern wrappers around the legacy MDS core; others are fully WordPress‑native.
- If you don’t see a submenu referenced here, it may be hidden until certain options are saved or features are enabled (e.g., WooCommerce).
